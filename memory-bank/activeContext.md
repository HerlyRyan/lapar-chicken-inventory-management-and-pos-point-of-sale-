## Current Goals

- Completed standardization of form layouts and image preview functionality across all three master data types (raw materials, semi-finished products, finished products). All six forms (3 create + 3 edit) now have consistent 6-column layouts, standardized image preview containers with 120px height, dashed borders for new previews, and unified JavaScript functions using class-based selectors.
